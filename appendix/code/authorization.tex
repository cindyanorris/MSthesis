\section{Authorization Components}

The authorization components are those which are responsible for managing access
control for \solt{contract}[s]. This section builds varying complexities of
access control beginning with:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Primitive Contract Ownership}, which reviews basic access control
    mechanisms; then

  \item \emph{Generalized Access Control}, which introduces components for
    guarding access to resources; next

  \item \emph{Access Control Lists}, which demonstrate components for
    constructing and managing access control lists and integrating them with the
    components introduced for generalized access control; and finally,

  \item \emph{Registries}, which demonstrates voter registry components
    leveraging the aforementioned components to build and manage voter
    databases.
\end{enumerate}
