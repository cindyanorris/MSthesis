\paragraph{Interface Ownership}

The \solt{interface}, \sol{interface Ownership}, introduces two
\solt{function}[s] for managing contract ownership:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \sol{function getOwner}, which is expected to return the \solt{address}
        of the owner of the \solt{contract}, and
  \item \sol{function setOwner}, which is expected to update the \solt{address}
        of the owner of the \solt{contract}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solidity}[interface Ownership]
interface Ownership {
  function getOwner () public view returns (address _owner);
  function setOwner (address _owner) public returns (bool _success);
}
\end{solidity}

\begin{interface}
  \begin{functions}
    \item \sol{function getOwner ()}, returns the \solt{address} of the owner of
      the \solt{contract}.

      \begin{returns}
        \item \sol{address _owner}, the \emph{subject} representing the owner of
          the \solt{contract}.
      \end{returns}

    \item \sol{function setOwner (address _owner)}, updates the \solt{address}
      representing the owner of the \solt{contract}.

      % which accepts an \solt{address},
      % \sol{address _owner}, and is expected to update the owner of the
      % \solt{contract} and \solt{return} a \solt{bool}, \sol{bool _success},
      % which resolves to \solt{true} if the operation was successful; otherwise
      % \solt{false}.


      \begin{parameters}
      \item \sol{address _owner}, the \emph{subject} which is to be granted
        ownership of the \solt{contract}.\footnotemark{}

        \footnotetext{\label{param:address-owner}
          The \solt{address} of the \emph{subject} may be \emph{any} Ethereum
          account, including \emph{contract accounts}.
        }
      \end{parameters}

      \begin{returns}
      \item \sol{bool _success}, resolves to \solt{true} if the operation was
        successful; otherwise \solt{false}.
      \end{returns}
