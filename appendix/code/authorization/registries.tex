\subsection{Registries}

Having completed the work of generalizing access control and building access
control lists, we now introduce a simplified access control model for managing
voter registration during elections.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \sol{interface Registry}, which defines the functions for registering
    voters for an election, and
  \item \sol{contract VoterRegistrationAuthority}, which implements and
    aggregates several \solt{interface}[s] and \solt{interface} implementations
    --- namely \sol{interface Registry}, \sol{interface Authority}, and
    \sol{contract ACLAuthority} --- to build a trusted source of registered
    voters.
\end{enumerate}
