\subsection{Primitive Contract Ownership}

Managing \solt{contract} ownership is one of the most basic forms of access
control in the Ethereum ecosystem. Here we introduce:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \sol{interface Ownership}, which defines \solt{function}[s] to
    express \solt{contract} ownership,
  \item \sol{contract RestrictTo}, which defines a \solt{modifier} for
    restricting access to \solt{function} calls based on an \solt{address}, and
  \item \sol{contract Owned}, a convenience \solt{contract}, which provides an
    implementation of \sol{interface Ownership} and leverages
    \sol{contract RestrictTo}.
\end{enumerate}
