\section{Architecture and Design}\label{sec:architecture-and-design}
The design of the system is approached in three phases: authorization, election,
and delegation. Each phase considers different components of the overall system
architecture and each component is responsible for managing a different set of
responsibilities within the architecture.

% The Embark framework --- a framework designed to build Decentralized
% Applications (DApps) --- is used to provision test networks, build, deploy,
% and test the components. The Embark framework can manage and deploy to
% different chains, e.g., testnet, private net, and livenet. Embark
% automatically detects changes to contracts, builds, and then deploys the
% contracts onto the appropriate Ethereum networks. To build Solidity code into
% EVM code the Embark framework uses solcjs which offers JavaScript bindings for
% the Solidity compiler. For expedited development and testing Embark exposes
% the Ethereum JavaScript testrpc which simulates a fully functioning Ethereum
% client. Interaction with Ethereum contracts is simplified by automatically
% generating promise-based JavaScript functions which expose contract functions.
% JavaScript support is provided by wrapping the web3js library which implements
% the generic Ethereum JSON RPC spec. Embark also supports decentralized storage
% via IPFS, decentralized messaging through Whisper and Orbit, and a curses-like
% dashboard which exposes logs, environment, contract states, available
% services, a console, and the status of the framework generally.
