% real world.}{The International IDEA Handbook of Electoral System Design}

This work designs, builds, and analyzes various electoral systems, electoral
features, and voter authentication models. Implementations are provided as smart
contracts which are used to determine their efficacy, feasibility, and usability
as tools to aid in on-chain decision-making processes.

It is undeniable that the underlying infrastructure and properties thereof,
which are intrinsic to blockchain technologies, present risks and weaknesses
with regard to voting; however, these properties also present unique
opportunities to explore non-traditional and novel approaches to governance
models, mechanisms, and electoral systems. This research aims to lean into the
advantages of the intrinsic properties made available by blockchain
technologies, while attempting to minimize the risks presented and weaknesses
exposed which are derived alongside them.

% offers the potential to explore non-traditional governance models and
% mechanisms, e.g., delegative democracies. This research aims to explore some of
% these non-traditional governance models and in general aims to lean into what
% advantages are made available through the underlying technologies while
% attempting to minimize the weaknesses and risks they present.

% Consideration must be paid to the limitations of the Ethereum Virtual Machine
% and Ethereum network, namely cost of storage, cost of computation, and
% limitations in regards to computation per block.
%
% Some electoral systems can be tallied through a simple summation of votes across
% choices, others must be tallied in multiple stages multiple times across
% pairwise combinations of simulated elections. Electoral systems which require
% the latter fare better in centralized systems where the cost of computation is
% less expensive.

% FIXME: Too Opinionated
%   Change `slaves to` to `bound by`.

% , we need not be bound by
% traditional electoral systems. Indeed, it is likely that the electoral systems
% that we are used to dealing with as citizens of monolithic and centralized
% governments are not appropriate for the fragmented crypto-anarchistic leaning
% groups of blockchain enthusiasts who are likely to participate in these
% decentralized organizations and communities.
