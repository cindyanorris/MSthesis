This chapter is broken into two major sections:

\begin{itemize}
   % \item \emph{Democracies and Electoral Systems}, which reviews domestic and
   %    foreign elections, voter's rights and legal protections, vote casting
   %    devices, the various processes and systems in place for casting votes,
   %    novel electoral systems and experiments, contentious elections, and the
   %    reasons why these contentious elections are regarded as such.

   \item \emph{Internet Voting}, which introduces Internet voting: procedures
      and concepts, and offers a survey of significant Internet voting systems,
      projects, pilots, and experiments.

   \item \emph{End-to-End Verifiability}, which introduces the concept of
      end-to-end verifiable (E2E-V) voting systems, reviews the functionalities
      required to support end-to-end verifiability (technical and
      non-functional), the architectural options available, existing E2E-V
      systems, and common cryptographic techniques available for use in such
      systems.

   % \item \emph{Blockchain Technology}, which reviews the Ethereum blockchain:
   %    its fundamental concepts and abstractions, internal data structures,
   %    algorithms, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), network topology and
   %    architecture.
