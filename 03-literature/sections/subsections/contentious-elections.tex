\subsection{Contentious Elections}
Despite having had thousands of years to improve on our election systems we
continue to see contentious election results both locally and abroad. What
follows are some of the more egregious and contentious election results.

\paragraph{American Elections}
\subparagraph{Bush vs Gore (2000 --- United States)}


\subparagraph{Trump vs Clinton (2016 --- United States)}
\begin{displayquote}
  ``A 58 percent majority of Clinton supporters say they accept Trump's
  election, while 33 percent do not. Questions about Trump's victory are
  passionate --- 27 percent of Clinton supporters feel ``strongly'' he did not
  win legitimately.''
\end{displayquote}

\paragraph{Foreign Elections}
\subparagraph{Gortari vs CÃ¡rdenas (1988 --- Mexico)}
