\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}

This chapter outlines the results of this research.
%
% produced in the process of implementing the
% authorization, election, and delegation components introduced in
% Section~\ref{sec:architecture-and-design}; provides benchmarks, test results,
% cost, and complexity analysis.
%
This chapter is divided into two major sections:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Test Results}, which reviews significant benchmarks, test results,
    and operational costs discovered in the design and implementation of this
    research.

  \item \emph{Analysis}, which uses the requirements and criteria, targeted in
    Section~\ref{sec:requirements}, and objectives targeted in
    Section~\ref{sec:objectives}, to measure the shortcoming and results of this
    research and also reviews insights and unexpected challenges encountered
    during the implementation phase.
\end{enumerate}

% Section: Testing
% \section{Implementation}
% After initial design the implementation of each component was approached
% independently.

%
% The procedure used to implement each of the components related to the election
% contracts occurred as follows:
%
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item An exploration of Finite State Machine design to manage transitioning
%     between the various voting phases.
%
%   \item Rudimentary implementations of each electoral system were implemented.
%
%     \begin{enumerate}
%       \item Tests were implemented to validate the basic functionalities of the
%         election contract and the correctness of the results produced by the
%         underlying electoral system implementation: voting, ballot tallying, and
%         winner selection process.
%     \end{enumerate}
