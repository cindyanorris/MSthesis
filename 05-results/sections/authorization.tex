\section{Authorization Components}

The authorization components are those which are responsible for managing access
control for \solt{contract}[s]. This section builds varying complexities of
access control beginning with:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Primitive Contract Ownership}, which reviews basic access control
    mechanisms; then

  \item \emph{Generalized Access Control}, which introduces components for
    guarding access to resources; next

  \item \emph{Access Control Lists}, which demonstrate components for
    constructing and managing access control lists and integrating them with the
    components introduced for generalized access control; and finally,

  \item \emph{Registries}, which demonstrates voter registry components
    leveraging the aforementioned components to build and manage voter
    databases.
\end{enumerate}

% Sub-sub-section: Managing Contract Ownership
\subsection{Primitive Contract Ownership}

Managing \solt{contract} ownership is one of the most basic forms of access
control in the Ethereum ecosystem. Here we introduce:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \sol{interface Ownership}, which defines \solt{function}[s] to
    express \solt{contract} ownership,
  \item \sol{contract RestrictTo}, which defines a \solt{modifier} for
    restricting access to \solt{function} calls based on an \solt{address}, and
  \item \sol{contract Owned}, a convenience \solt{contract}, which provides an
    implementation of \sol{interface Ownership} and leverages
    \sol{contract RestrictTo}.
\end{enumerate}

% Sub-sub-section: Generalizing Contract Access Control
\subsection{Generalizing Contract Access Control}

In order to generalize \solt{contract} access control we introduce:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \sol{interface Authority}, which defines \solt{function}[s] to determine
    whether some \emph{subject} is permitted to access some \emph{resource},
  \item \sol{contract Authorization}, which defines a \solt{modifier} for
    restricting access to \solt{function} calls based on an \solt{address}, and
  \item \sol{contract Guard}, a convenience \solt{contract}, which provides an
    implementation of \sol{interface Authorization} by aggregating
    implementations of \sol{interface Authority}.
\end{enumerate}

Together these components allow us to provide a generalized access control
model; isolating and deferring the responsibilities of
authorization.\footnotemark{}
\todo{Alternative names: Guard, Authority, Enforcer, Authorization}

\footnotetext{
  I think I would maybe prefer \sol{interface Authorization} to define
  \sol{isAuthorized} and for \sol{interface Authority} to define
  \sol{getAuthority} and \sol{setAuthority}.

  A better name in that case might be \sol{interface AuthorityManager}.

% Sub-sub-section: Access Control Lists
\subsection{Access Control Lists}

We introduce access control lists to provide a generalized form of access
control through a well-understood and common interface:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \sol{interface AccessControlList}, which defines the basic actions
    required for an access control list implementation;

  \item \sol{contract BasicACL}, which provides a basic implementation of
    \sol{interface AccessControlList}; and

  \item \sol{contract ACLAuthority}, which aggregates an
    \solt{interface AccessControlList} implementation, \sol{contract BasicACL}
    in this case, to back an \sol{interface Authority} implementation.
\end{enumerate}

% Sub-sub-section: Registries
\subsection{Registries}

Having completed the work of generalizing access control and building access
control lists, we now introduce a simplified access control model for managing
voter registration during elections.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \sol{interface Registry}, which defines the functions for registering
    voters for an election, and
  \item \sol{contract VoterRegistrationAuthority}, which implements and
    aggregates several \solt{interface}[s] and \solt{interface} implementations
    --- namely \sol{interface Registry}, \sol{interface Authority}, and
    \sol{contract ACLAuthority} --- to build a trusted source of registered
    voters.
\end{enumerate}
